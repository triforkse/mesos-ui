# YAMU - Yet Another Mesos UI

A UI for getting an overview of your Mesos cluster.

## Planned Features

☐ Nice Looking Visual Overview of Cluster Resources  
☐ Simple Configuration of Frameworks through ProtoBuf.
☐ Client Library for supporting frameworks to expose their configuration
☐ REST API
☐ Adaptors for Frameworks that do not yet support YAMU

# Developer Setup

To get started run

```bash
$ make setup
```

This will install any dependencies.

The project consists of a web client, and an API. These two can be deployed
separately. You also need to start them separately:

```bash
$ cd api && make run
$ cd client && make run
```

This will also run your unit tests while developing.

## Tests

You can run the tests manually by running:

```bash
make test
```

If you wish to run the E2E tests you can either do it by running:

```bash
$ make test-e2e
```

This requires that you have both the `client` and `api` running on
your machine.

You can also execute them in docker containers, using:

```bash
$ make docker-e2e
```

### To Get Growl Test Notifications Working

```
